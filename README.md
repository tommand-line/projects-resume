# A-Like

**Flutter, Mobile Programming, Responsiveness, State Handling**

_Dart, BLoC, Firebase_

- Social mobile application that, leveraging gamification concepts, aims to improve the social life of users by bringing them together in nightclubs. The application collects anonymous user data such as age and main interests and aggregates participants in the events that are made available by the entities participating in the service. In this way, the user can choose the event that interests him/her the most, and, via a qr code, could meet another random user of the app and have a word with a drink offered by the bar
- The application is written in the dart language, leveraging the flutter framework to ensure compatibility with both android and ios. It also features a Pine architecture that ensures its scalability and flexibility, taking advantage of application state management via BLoC providers

# Double-Identity Fingerprint Detection \& Enhancement

**DL, GAN, CNN**

_Python, Tensorflow, GradCAM_

- This project aims to counter identity theft crimes by possible criminals at airport ATMs, called ABC gates. These counters can automatically identify, through fingerprint scanning, the identity and authenticity of a person. In fact, by exploiting fusion algorithms, criminals are able to merge their fingerprints with those of people without criminal records, evading security checks
- A generative model (GAN) has been trained through deep learning techniques to generate counterfeit fingerprints so that they are not recognizable to the human eye. Once visually acceptable results were obtained, an additional image classification model (CNN) was trained that could extrapolate patterns from the counterfeit fingerprints that would distinguish them from legitimate fingerprints with high accuracy
- At the technology stack level, Python was used as the programming language, supported by image processing libraries such as NumPy and OpenCV. Tensorflow's Keras library was used to build the architecture of the models, train them, and evaluate their performance through specially created graphs and tables

# OptiTrade

**Python, DL, RL**

_PyTorch, NumPy, Gym_

- The project is an automatic trading bot trained to trade directly on the stock market, composed of a series of neural models grafted together to ensure high accuracy in market choices
- The bot was trained through Reinforcement Learning by exploiting one of the state-of-the-art algorithms, namely MP-DQN. In this way, it is not only able to autonomously choose which market operation to undertake, but also can deduce with which operation parameters to use
- Technologies such as Gym were used to train the model to simulate the virtual environment in which the bot is to act, PyTorch to build the LSTM and CNN neural models, Numpy to do data pre-processing on market values to pass to the model to train

# Cancer Prevention

**Weka, ML, Data Mining, Data Processing**

_J48, Naive-Bayes_

- This project consists of the analysis of health data from patients with benign or malignant breast tumors. Based on this analysis, machine learning models have been built which, by exploiting the data, are able to predict with high accuracy and low probability of error whether a patient has a benign or malignant tumor, in order to implement prevention measures in advance
- Weka was used as a data visualization, interpretation and cleaning tool, to make the training of the models more precise and capable of generalizing on patients it has never seen during training
- A classification tree, a rule-based classifier and a Bayesian probability-based classifier were used as prediction models

# BallBlast

**Agile Team, OOP, MVC**

_Java, Git, Eclipse_

- The project consists of the implementation of an arcade game in which the aim is simply to score higher than the other players
- During the development of the code, Git was used as a versioning tool and an Agile methodology to ensure the correct execution and synchronization of all team activities
- Java was used as the programming language, following an object-oriented programming paradigm that exploits the MVC pattern, thus breaking down the architecture to make the code flexible and scalable

# PopIt

**Akka, Scrum, OOP, Logic Programming**

_Scala, Prolog, Trello, Git, IntelliJ_

- The project consists of an arcade game developed in Scala with the Akka framework to exploit reactive programming for independent actors
- The Scrum methodology was chosen to coordinate the project activities

# Boardify

**MEVN Stack, Web Application**

_Node, Express, Vue, MongoDB, Bootstrap, Git_

- Single page web application that allows users to coordinate team work, breaking down tasks into specifically created sections
- A MEVN type technology stack was used, which therefore uses Express and Node for the backend, MongoDB as a non-relational database and Vue to compose the frontend part

# WonderTicket

**Website, Agile Team**

_HTML, PHP, CSS, Git_

- Simple website developed with HTML, PHP and CSS to enrich the interface, simulating a concert and event ticket provider

# Turism RehApp

**Android, Mobile Programming, Gamification**

_Java, Android Studio_

- Mobile application created to encourage tourism after the Covid-19 pandemic
- Taking advantage of gamification concepts, the application is aimed at young users so as not to get bored while visiting Italian cities. In fact, while their parents are busy wandering around typical places, the application allows the child to interact with them to unlock virtual souvenirs to collect by completing minigames
- The application was developed natively using the Java language, therefore only available in the Android version
